# CE888 Module - Project 2 - Assignment 2
## Project Title: Fine-Tuning DeBERTa and BERTweet on Three Heterogeneous Tweet Classification Tasks

This repository contains the all the code for assignment 2 of the Data Science and Decesion Making module.  

### Datasets 
Three different datasets have been used to train and evaluate DeBERTa and BERTweet models. The datasets were provided by TweetEval, a unified benchmark for evaluating tweets classification: 
  * Hate Speech Detection Dataset ([Link](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval/tree/main/datasets/hate)).
  * Emotion Recognition Dataset ([Link](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval/tree/main/datasets/emotion)).
  * Sentiment Analysis Dataset ([Link](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval/tree/main/datasets/sentiment)).


### Notebooks' Structure:
All notebooks have been organized in the same manner, as follows:

  * Loading Libraries and Dataset
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Exploring the tokenization and attention mask process
  * Pre-Processing Steps
  * Fine-Tuning and Evaluating the Model
     * Macro-Averaged Recall Score
    * Saving the best model
    * Loading the saved model
